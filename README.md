PenaltyShootoutCodeGolf


This is the controler for the code golf challenge "Penalty Shootout"

To run this you just simply run the program as "python arbeiter.py" in command prompt.

Then you type all the files you want to run (Python use stdin). When typing, seperate the files with space.(So if your contestant is p1.py and p2.py then run 'python arbeiter.py' in command prompt, then type 'p1.py p2.py' then press enter)

The program after executes all matches will make a file called 'standing.txt' returns how many points each player gets.

This program can run '.py' and '.exe' So for C and C++, you need to compile it manually before you run it.
